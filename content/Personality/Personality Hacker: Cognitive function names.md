The Personality Hacker model has given names for each function in the cognitive function stack as proposed by the MBTI. Joel Mark Witt and Antonia Dodge of Personality Hacker have given unique names to the cognitive functions to make them more relatable and easier to understand for people who are new to the MBTI and cognitive functions.

Here's the list of the eight Jungian cognitive functions as named by Personality Hacker:

- Extraverted Feeling (Fe): Harmony - This function is about connecting with others and creating harmonious relationships. It's concerned with the emotional atmosphere of a situation and seeks to maintain or create peace.

- Introverted Thinking (Ti): Accuracy - This function is about analyzing information for accuracy and consistency. It seeks to understand how things work and to make logical sense of the world.

- Extraverted Thinking (Te): Effectiveness - This function is about organizing the external world and getting things done. It seeks to create efficient systems and processes.

- Introverted Feeling (Fi): Authenticity - This function is about staying true to oneself and one's values. It seeks to understand what feels right on a personal level.

- Extraverted Intuition (Ne): Exploration - This function is about seeing possibilities and exploring ideas. It's curious about the external world and is always looking for connections between seemingly unrelated things.

- Introverted Intuition (Ni): Perspectives - This function is about understanding the deeper meaning behind things and seeing patterns. It's like having an internal framework that makes sense of the world.

- Extraverted Sensing (Se): Sensation - This function is about being in the present moment and experiencing life as it comes. It's attuned to the immediate environment and is very aware of sensory details.

- Introverted Sensing (Si): Memory - This function is about recalling past experiences and using them as a reference point for current situations. It seeks to maintain traditions and routines.

These names are meant to be more descriptive and intuitive than the traditional MBTI terminology, making it easier for newcomers to grasp the essence of each function.
