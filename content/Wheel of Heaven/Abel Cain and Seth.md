## Abel

Abel is a Biblical figure in the Book of Genesis within Abrahamic religions. He was the younger brother of Cain, and the younger son of Adam and Eve, the first couple in Biblical history. He was a shepherd who offered his firstborn flock up to God as an offering. God accepted his offering but not his brother's. Cain then killed Abel out of jealousy. According to Genesis, this was the first murder in the history of mankind. 

According to the narrative in Genesis, Abel (Hebrew: הֶבֶל Hébel, in pausa הָבֶל Hā́ḇel; Biblical Greek: Ἅβελ Hábel; Arabic: هابيل, Hābēl) is Eve's second son. His name in Hebrew is composed of the same three consonants as a root meaning "breath". Julius Wellhausen has proposed that the name is independent of the root. Eberhard Schrader had previously put forward the Akkadian (Old Assyrian dialect) ablu ("son") as a more likely etymology.

## Cain

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain

Cain is a Biblical figure in the Book of Genesis within Abrahamic religions. He is the elder brother of Abel, and the firstborn son of Eve. When he gave an offering of his crops to God, God was not pleased and favored Abel's offering over Cain's. Out of jealousy, Cain killed his brother, for which he was punished by God with the curse and mark of Cain. He had several children, starting with Enoch and including Lamech.

The narrative is notably unclear on God's reason for rejecting Cain's sacrifice. Some traditional interpretations consider Cain to be the originator of evil, violence, or greed. According to Genesis, Cain was the first human born and the first murderer.

### Mormon theology

In Latter-day Saint theology, Cain is considered to be the quintessential **Son of Perdition**, the father of **secret combinations** (i.e. secret societies and organized crime), as well as the first to hold the title **Master Mahan** meaning master of [the] great secret, that [he] may murder and get gain.

A **son of perdition** is a person who will not take part in the glory of God in the afterlife. 

A **secret combination**, in the accounts of the Book of Mormon, is a term that describes a malignant secret society of "people bound together by oaths to carry out the evil purposes of the group." Secret combinations were first discussed in the Book of Mormon, which was published in 1830 by Joseph Smith. The most notable example of a secret combination is the Gadianton robbers, a conspiracy throughout much of the narrative of the Book of Mormon. According to the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, Cain also entered a secret combination with Satan and became Master Mahan.

**Master Mahan** is a title assumed first by Cain and later by his descendant Lamech. The title indicates that Cain and Lamech were each the "master" of a "great secret" in which they covenanted with Satan to kill for personal gain.

## Seth

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth

Seth, in the Abrahamic religions, was the third son of Adam and Eve. According to the Hebrew Bible, he had two brothers: Cain and Abel. According to Genesis 4:25, Seth was born after Abel's murder by Cain, and Eve believed that God had appointed him as a replacement for Abel. He is the only other child of Adam and Eve named in the Bible. According to the Book of Genesis, Seth was born when Adam was 130 years old (according to the Masoretic Text), or 230 years old (according to the Septuagint), "a son in his likeness and image". The genealogy is repeated at 1 Chronicles 1:1–3. Genesis 5:4–5 states that Adam fathered "sons and daughters" before his death, aged 930 years. According to Genesis, Seth died at the age of 912 (that is, 14 years before Noah's birth).

Seth figures in the pseudepigraphical texts of the Life of Adam and Eve (the Apocalypse of Moses). It recounts the lives of Adam and Eve from after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden to their deaths. While the surviving versions were composed from the early third to the fifth century, the literary units in the work are considered to be older and predominantly of Jewish origin. There is wide agreement that the original was composed in a Semitic language in the first century AD/CE. In the Greek versions, Seth and Eve travel to the doors of the Garden to beg for some oil of the Tree of Mercy (i.e. the Tree of Life). On the way, Seth is attacked and bitten by a wild beast, which goes away when ordered by Seth. Michael refuses to give them the oil at that time, but promises to give it at the end of time, when all flesh will be raised up, the delights of paradise will be given to the holy people and God will be in their midst. On their return, Adam says to Eve: "What hast thou done? Thou hast brought upon us great wrath which is death." (chapters 5–14) Later, only Seth can witness the taking-up of Adam at his funeral in a divine chariot, which deposits him in the Garden of Eden.

Genesis refers to Seth as the ancestor of Noah and hence the father of all Hamitic peoples, all other Gammerites having perished in the Great Flood. It is said that late in life, Adam gave Seth secret teachings that would become the Kabbalah. The Zohar refers to Seth as "ancestor of all the generations of the Egyptians or Tsetsaudim" (Hebrew: righteous ones). According to Seder Olam Rabbah, based on Jewish reckoning, he was born in 2130 BC AM. According to Aggadah, he had 2 sons and many wives. According to the Seder Olam Rabbah, he died in 1042 AM.

## Genesis

## Raëlian Genesis

The new human beings then understood that they could also become creators in their turn, and they became angry at their "parents" for having kept them away from scientific books, considering them to be like dangerous laboratory animals.

> And Yahweh Elohim said unto the serpent, 'Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed... upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.' — Genesis 3: 14.

The "serpent" was this small group of creators who had wished to tell the truth to Adam and Eve, and as a result they were condemned by the government of their own planet to live in exile on Earth, while all the other scientists had to put a stop to their experiments and leave the Earth.

> Unto Adam also and to his wife did Yahweh Elohim make coats of skins, and clothed them. — Genesis 3: 21.

The creators gave their creations the basic means of survival, **enough to manage without needing any further contact with them.**

The Bible has preserved a sentence, which is close to the original document:

    Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil2: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.

    — Genesis 3: 22.

[...]

> So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. — Genesis 3: 24.

Soldiers with atomic disintegration weapons were placed at the entrance to the creators' residence to prevent human beings from stealing more scientific knowledge. '

Let us move on to the fourth chapter of Genesis.

> And in process of time it came to pass, that **Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Yahweh**. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. — Genesis 4: 3-4.

The creators in exile who were left under military surveillance, urged the human beings to bring them food in order to show their own superiors that the newly created people were good, and that they would never turn against their creators. Thus they managed to obtain permission for the leaders of these first human beings to benefit from the "tree of life", and this explains how they lived so long: Adam lived for 930 years, Seth for 912 years and Enos for 905 years, and so on as is stated in Genesis, Chapter 5, Verses 1-11.

> And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of Elohim saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. — Genesis 6: 1-2.

The creators living in exile took the most beautiful daughters of humanity and made them their wives.

> My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. — Genesis 6: 3.

Longevity is not hereditary and much to the relief of the authorities on the distant planet, the children of the new human beings did not automatically benefit from the "tree of life". Thus the secret of life was lost, and mankind's progress was slowed down.

> When the sons of Elohim came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. — Genesis 6: 4.

There you have proof that the creators could have intercourse with the daughters of humanity whom they had created in their own image, and in so doing produced exceptional children. These actions seemed very dangerous to people on the distant planet. The scientific progress on Earth was fantastic, and they decided to destroy what had been created.

> And Elohim saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. — Genesis 6: 5.

The "evil" in question was the desire of human beings to become scientific and independent people equal to their creators. Being "good", as far as those on the Elohim's planet were concerned meant the new human beings would remain primitive, vegetating on the Earth. Their "evil" was their wish to progress, perhaps enabling them one day to catch up with their creators.

The government then decided from their distant planet to destroy all life on Earth by sending nuclear missiles. However when the exiled creators were informed of the project they asked Noah to build a spaceship, which would orbit the Earth during the cataclysm containing a pair of each species that was to be preserved.
