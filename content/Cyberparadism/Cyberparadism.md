## Aesthetic Wiki

https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberparadism

Cyberparadism is a subset of Cyberprep and therefore of Post-Cyberpunk. The word is an amalgam of the prefix "cyber-", referring to cybernetics, and "paradism" as in paradise, meaning that a paradisal aspect has to be present within the cybernetic part of the aesthetic. The paradisal aspect can either manifest itself in literal terms as it would when representing a derivation of a Garden of Eden or the Elysian Fields, or alternatively in a more abstract way as a reflection of a utopia state of things.

It differs itself from Cyberprep insofar that not only the positive benefits of technological progress are a central tenet, but that said technological progress has reached a level of sophistication where the principles of economics and conventional labour are fundamentally transformed in such that the subjects at hand can and are likely to pursue higher goals of scientific, technological, civilizatory and/or spiritual fulfillment.

This pursuit of higher goals is reflected in the societal structures of Cyberparadism. While smaller communities or highly dense urban pods are common, they are often highly interconnected and work towards shared goals, such as preserving the environment or advancing scientific research. This emphasis on cooperation and shared purpose is a hallmark of Cyberparadism, and is made possible by the advanced technology that has allowed for a post-scarcity society.

In Cyberparadism, the paradisal aspect is not just a surface-level aesthetic choice, but a fundamental part of the subgenre's philosophy. By incorporating technology in a way that enhances and preserves the natural world, Cyberparadism offers a vision of a future that is not only sustainable, but also fulfilling and meaningful for its inhabitants. It challenges the assumption that progress must come at the expense of the environment, and presents a hopeful alternative where humans and nature can thrive together in harmony.

## tl;dr

Cyberparadism in a nutshell is an aesthetic that features lots of untamed nature, usually tropical or jungle-like, where a small-numbered breakaway civilization uses highly-advanced technology (but not hard science-fiction, unrealistic, too distant future) for self-preservation and/or luxurious comfort that enables a quasi-hedonistic lifestyle. Common themes are genetic life engineering, terraformation, exoplanets or other types of space frontiers.

## Manifesto

https://github.com/zarazinsfuss/cyberparadism-manifesto/blob/main/README.md

This is a web manifesto of the Cyberparadism aesthetic. Cyberparadism originated on the Aesthetics Wiki where it got formalized for the first time and is an aesthetic that celebrates the positive potential of technology and scientific progress to create a better future for humanity. At its core, Cyberparadism is about using technology to enhance the human experience, promote sustainability, and foster a sense of collective purpose and responsibility.
