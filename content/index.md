Welcome to my second brain. A second brain is a digital space where ideas, insights and clues for further research are offloaded to. Second brains are also known as digital gardens where ideas bloom and thoughts intertwine and need to be taken care of as with actual gardens. Explore and enjoy the ever-evolving landscape of this space. On a technical level, this is based on a customized fork of [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), a type of open-source static-site generator that specializes in converting Obsidian-like markdown files into a functional website such as this one. I highly encourage everyone to offload their stream of thoughts and cherish their own gardens of knowledge.
