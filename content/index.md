Welcome to my second brain—a digital garden where ideas bloom and thoughts intertwine. Explore and enjoy the ever-evolving landscape of this garden. This space is built and maintained with [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), an open-source static-site generator converting Obsidian-like markdown files into a functional website such as this one. I highly encourage everyone to grow their own gardens of knowledge.
